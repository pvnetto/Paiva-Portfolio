# My Portfolio

[Live Version](https://paiva-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)

My portfolio page, made with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), [React-Three-Fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

## Layout

I draft all my websites on Figma before doing them. For this one, I ended up using a wireframe/hacker aesthetic that is not represented in the draft, but the layout was totally preserved.
